I am a person with a great progressive attitude holding a motive towards my goal and career.

My interest in computers led me to take up Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at MLR Institute of Technology (MLRIT), affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTU-H), India. The engineering environment at MLRIT was apt for learning and innovating great things as the course in Computer Science and Engineering covered a wide panorama of subjects. In college, I always enjoyed long hours in the labs as it gave me the opportunity to correlate theory to practical phenomena. This in turn gave me better understanding of the subjects and newer lines of thinking.

I worked on IoT project for ‘Smart Automatic Street light’ in my second semester which garnered lot of praise from the institution. Third year was my favourite year where I was exposed to different domains under computer science. I got an opportunity to work on ‘Call Off Farm’, an IoT based project. This project was an initiative of the students of the Aeronautical Department.  Together we developed a mobile controlled rover for automatic farm irrigation for which we won the ‘Best Project-Smart Agriculture’ award at the CMR-Hackathon organized by JHUB in 2019. Another project called ‘Crowd prediction in the banks’ helped me to understand the implementation of machine learning algorithm.

I have also attended various workshops on different technologies. One of them was on Artificial Intelligence which helped me to work on and develop my mini project ‘Smart Attendance System based on AI’. In this project, we proposed the plan and utilization of a face detection and recognition framework to help recognize students going to a classroom and stamp their attendance by perceiving their faces. In this, the recognized face in the picture will be compared with the already stored face at the time of enrolment. It was a wonderful experience to work on this project with my team-mates which helped me to gain a lot of practical knowledge. I have been working on various project domains like Web development and Artificial Intelligence.
